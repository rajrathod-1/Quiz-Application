**Application Description:** 
The application opens on the home page. There are three buttons available to the user to navigate the app, namely "Courses", "Calendar", and "Profile".

Clicking on the "Courses" button navigates the user to the Courses tab. From here, the user has access to a list of courses. The user can choose to sort courses in the list based on date added, subject, name, course code and favourites. When a course is selected from the list, its details are shown below. There are also buttons that allow the user to favourite the selected course as well as navigate to a page to view course notes and quiz cards. The user can also choose to delete the selected course using the "Delete Course" button.

From the Course tab, the user can click on the notes button to a page that displays notes taken for the course. The user has access to a list of notes on the left and when one is selected, the title and its contents are shown on the right. The user can press the back button at the top left to return to the course page.

From the Course tab, the user can click on the quiz card button to navigate to a page where they can quiz themselves on course material. A question is shown to the user and its answer can be revealed by pressing the "Reveal Answer" button. The user can navigate between quiz cards through the "Prev" and "Next" buttons. To return to the course page, the user can press the back button at the top left.

Clicking on the "Calendar" button navigates the user to the Calendar tab. From here, the user can view the current month and navigate to previous and upcoming months.
